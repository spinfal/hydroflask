# hydroflask
this is buggy and built poorly, its a very stupid/cool way to get a websites html source and view it in a flask app, bc that is useful :)

# but spin, how do i run this?
<br>good question, you shouldnt. it sucks and is very useless.
<br>but if youre feeling extra stupid today, just run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
<br>(or if you decide to run this on repl.it, then just delete `requirements.txt` and hit the run button)
<br>then run `main.py`
<br>then, use it. enjoy?
